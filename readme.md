This is a project to provide rich(er) visualizations for the common strategy tools that some execs, investors, and marketing teams find useful. Examples are SWOT quadrants, Porter's Five Forces, etc.

Primarily it is a good intentioned reason for me to finally learn d3.js and the MEAN stack.

Success is not guaranteed. I have only done this once before.

Right now I only have the SWOT quadrants drawn, and not as good as I would like

TODO
